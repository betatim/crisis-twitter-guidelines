# crisis-twitter-guidelines
Developing a simple guide for local people to get heard during a disaster.

🚧 This is a young project, lots of things are still undecided.
Everyone is welcome to [contribute](https://github.com/betatim/crisis-twitter-guidelines/blob/master/README.md#ideas-contribute).🚧

# Problem
When a natural disaster occurs, lots of aid can arrive quickly, but the helpers lack local knowledge and information on where to go first.
What they need are local [Gandalfs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gandalf).
This is especially true in the first few hours or days of an emergency.
People have tried to use Twitter and social media to get better information but often there is too much noise and not enough signal.

# Solution
This project contains simple guidelines for social-media users who are affected by, or close to, a crisis.
The idea is to make their tweets easier to find and more actionable by following three simple guidelines:

1. **Attach a picture** to your tweet - a picture says more than 1000 words
2. **[Enable geotagging](https://support.twitter.com/articles/78525#)** - let people know where it is you are reporting from
3. Use the hashtag **[#SOS](https://twitter.com/hashtag/sos?f=tweets)** - to make it easy to find your tweet

In addition, if you have the time it will be useful if you can:

* Try to stay online and answer questions
* Consider creating a new account to protect your privacy
    * If you do want to protect your privacy, make sure that you're not sharing images with any metadata that can be traced to you.
